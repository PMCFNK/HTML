<h1 id="Plot">Plot</h1>
    <p>In April of 1945, the Allies make their final push into Nazi Germany, encountering fanatical resistance. Don "Wardaddy" Collier, a battle-hardened U.S. Army Staff Sergeant in the Second Armored Division, commands an M4 Sherman tank nicknamed Fury and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd "Bible" Swan, loader Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis, driver Trini "Gordo" Garcia, and assistant driver–bow gunner "Red," all of whom have fought together since the North African campaign. Red is killed in a tank battle and replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, a young clerk from V Corps.</p>

    <p>As Fury moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: He fails to stop some Hitler Youth child soldiers from ambushing the platoon leader's tank with a Panzerfaust, which kills the entire crew. Later, he hesitates under fire during a battle with anti-tank guns. After the battle, Don orders Norman to execute a German prisoner. When he refuses, Don wrestles the pistol into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman.</p>

    <p>After the platoon captures a small town, Don and Norman search an apartment and encounter a German woman named Irma, and her younger cousin Emma. Don pays them for a hot meal and some hot water for a shave. Norman and Emma bond, and at Don's urging, the two go into the bedroom and become intimate. Later, as the four sit down to eat, the rest of the crew drunkenly barges in, harassing the women and bullying Norman, but Don firmly rebukes them. They are then called away for an urgent mission, but German artillery strikes the town as they prepare to leave, which kills Emma and further traumatizes Norman.</p>

    <p>The tanks receive orders to capture and hold a vital crossroads to protect the division's vulnerable rear lines. En route, they are ambushed by a Tiger tank, which wipes out the entire platoon except for Fury. Fury eventually destroys the Tiger by outmaneuvering it and firing into its thinner rear armor. Unable to notify his superiors because the radio has been damaged, Don decides they must continue their mission. Upon arriving at the crossroads, the tank is immobilized by a landmine. Don sends Norman to scout a nearby hill; from there, he spots a battalion of Waffen-SS infantry approaching. Don decides to stay, convincing the others to stand and fight.</p>

    <p>The men disguise Fury to make it appear knocked out and then hide inside. While they wait, the crew finally gives Norman a nickname – "Machine" – to show their acceptance of him. They then ambush the Germans, inflicting heavy casualties in a long and vicious battle. Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust that penetrates the turret, Gordo is shot while unpinning a grenade and sacrifices himself by covering it before it explodes, then a sniper kills Bible and severely wounds Don. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Don orders Norman to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop potato masher grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, killing Don. Norman tries to hide as the Germans move on, but is spotted by a young SS soldier. The soldier hesitates, then leaves, deciding not to alert his comrades.</p>

    <p>The next morning, Norman crawls back into the tank, where he covers Don's body with his jacket. He is rescued by American soldiers who praise him as a hero. As Norman is driven away in an ambulance, he looks back at the disabled Fury while the American troops continue their advance.
